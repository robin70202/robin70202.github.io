In 2016, he was selected as a Fellow of the Japan Foundation and carried out his dissertation research in the University of Tokyo. His research was also financially supported by the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation, Cambridge University, and European Research Council.</p>

He is currently completing his book titled The Making of America’s Maritime Order in Cold War East Asia: Sovereignty, Local Interests, and International Security.
